[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/mykabam/requestNotificationPermission.png)](https://gemnasium.com/mykabam/requestNotificationPermission)

A handy directive to [request Notification permission](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-notifications-20120614/#permission) from user.

## Browser supports

* Chrome >= v22.0
* Firefox >= v22.0

## How to Install

To use this directive, fist you need to install it via [Bower](http://bower.io/).
I assume you already install the Bower:

```
bower install kabam-requestNotificationPermission
```

Include the directive `script requestNotificationPermission.js` into your application:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/kabam-requestNotificationPermission/requestNotificationPermission.js"></script>
```

Add `kabam.requestNotificationPermission` as a module dependency to your application

```
angular.module('yourAwesomeApplication', [
  'kabam.requestNotificationPermission'
]);
```
## How to Use

To use this directive, you need to add new attribute `request-notification-permission` to your html element.
For examples:

You might want to use the directive this way if you need to get the user permission in the first time they load the application.
```
<body request-notification-permission>Call</body>
```

You might want to use the directive this way if you need to get the user permission after they click some element or button.
```
<button request-notification-permission>Call</button>
```

The attribute can be given a value that should evaluate to a boolean (or 'true' / 'false' string) to enable / disable it.
For example:

```
<body request-notification-permission="{{isLogin}}">Call</body>
```

Would use the value of $scope.isLogin to only make the request after the user is logged-in
